        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
        that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
        It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
        write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can
        run on all platforms that support Java without the need to
        recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that
        can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
        computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but
        has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime
        provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code
        modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled
