        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
        language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of
        websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10] Web
        browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client
        code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of
        apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).

        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
        networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web
        browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two
        languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
